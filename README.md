# TextCloud
Final project for Introduction to Computer Science class during my freshman year of college, written in Python. Completed in December
2011. The finished site can be found at the following URL:

URL: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~akowtko/textclouds/index.html

**DO NOT CHANGE THE URL LISTED ON THAT PAGE**. The script follows links on each page and will continue following each page's links until
the "depth" has been reached. The preloaded URL is a safe site, but entering any other URL could crash other sites. The script collects
words and their frequency listed on each page, and can recognize conjugated verbs as their corresponding infinitive.
